# cross-stitch-pattern-from-image

A demo is (probably) up [here](https://pattern.sadlads.com).

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have Python 3.x and `pip` installed.

### Linux Users: Installing Microsoft Fonts

If you're running on Linux, you may need to install Microsoft Core fonts to ensure proper font rendering. On Ubuntu, you can do this by running the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ttf-mscorefonts-installer
```

## Running the Program

To run, you can simply run the `run.sh` script on Linux, or `run.bat` script on Windows.

This will attempt to create a Python virtual environment, activate it, install the requirements, and run the program.

Otherwise, you can do the following:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

You should be able to access it through http://localhost:5000
